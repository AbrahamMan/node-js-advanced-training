1. **Calculator of perimeter and area of geometric shapes**
Use ES6 classes to create a base class for geometric shapes with the possibility of calculating `perimeter`, `area` and `format the output` of this values.
After create classes for the `rectangle`, `circle`, `triangle` and `trapezoid`. 
They have to use the general functionality from the base class and include only the specific code.
