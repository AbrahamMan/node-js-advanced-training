1. **Calculator of perimeter and area of geometric shapes**

Use ES6 classes to create a base class for geometric shapes with the possibility of calculating `perimeter`, `area` and `format the output` of these values (in `millimeters`/`centimeter`/`meters` for `perimeter` and `millimeters²`/`centimeters²`/`meters²` for `area`).
After create classes for the `Rectangle`, `Circle`, `Triangle` and `Trapezoid`. 
They have to use the general functionality from the base class and have to include only the specific code for specific shape.
