# Node.js

`Node.js` is a JavaScript runtime built on `Chrome's V8 JavaScript` engine. 
`Node.js` uses an `event-driven`, `non-blocking I/O model` that makes it lightweight and efficient. 
`Node.js` package ecosystem, npm, is the largest ecosystem of open source libraries in the world.

# Node.js Philosophy

## Small core

The Node.js core should be kept as small as possible.
The ecosystem of modules living outside the core.

    Write modules that do one thing well. Write a new module rather than complicate an old one.

    Write modules that encourage composition rather than extension.

    Write modules that handle data Streams, because that is the universal interface.

    Write modules that are agnostic about the source of their input or the destination of their output.

    Write modules that solve a problem you know, so you can learn about the ones you donâ€™t.

    Write modules that are small. Iterate quickly. Refactor ruthlessly. Rewrite bravely.

    Write modules quickly, to meet your needs, with just a few tests for compliance. Avoid extensive specifications. Add a test for each bug you fix.

    Write modules for publication, even if you only use them privately. You will appreciate documentation in the future.

    Working is better than perfect.

    Focus is better than features.

    Compatibility is better than purity.

    Simplicity is better than anything.
